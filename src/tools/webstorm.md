WebStorm is an IDE from JetBrains for client-side development.
It comes with the Dart plugin pre-installed.

If you're interested in using Dart
with another JetBrains IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, see the page
[Dart Plugin from JetBrains]({{site.dartlang}}/tools/jetbrains-plugin).

## Getting started

To get started with WebStorm,
install it and then tell it where to find the Dart SDK.

### Installing software

* [Install WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/) or,
  to try out the latest Dart language features,
  [Install WebStorm EAP](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/WI/WebStorm+EAP)
* [Install the Dart SDK]({{site.dartlang}}/install)


### Configuring Dart support

Here's one way to configure Dart support in WebStorm:

<ol>
<li>
  <p>
    Create a new Dart project:
  </p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li> From the Welcome screen, click <b>Create New Project</b>.</li>
    <li> In the next dialog, click <b>Dart</b>.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<br>

<li>
  <p>
    If you don't see a value for the <b>Dart SDK</b> path, enter it.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, the SDK path might be
    <code><em>&lt;dart installation directory></em>/dart/dart-sdk</code>.
  </p>

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  <b>Note:</b>
  The <b>Dart SDK</b> path specifies the directory that
  contains the SDK's `bin` and `lib` directories;
  the `bin` directory contains tools such as `dart` and `dart2js`.
  WebStorm ensures that the path is valid.
  For more information, see the Dart installation guide for your OS:
  [Windows]({{site.dartlang}}/install/windows),
  [Linux]({{site.dartlang}}/install/linux), or
  [Mac]({{site.dartlang}}/install/mac).
</aside>
</li>
</ol>

An alternative to Step 1
is to open an existing Dart project,
and then open its `pubspec.yaml` file or any of its Dart files.
