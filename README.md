# Site for _Dart for the web_ ([webdev.dartlang.org][])

[![Build Status SVG][]][@travis]
[![first-timers-only SVG][]][first-timers-only]

The [webdev.dartlang.org][] site, built with [Jekyll][] and hosted on [Firebase][].

[We welcome contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md), and we're [first-timer friendly](http://www.firsttimersonly.com)!

For simple changes (such as to CSS and text), you probably don't need to build this site.
But if you want/need to build, here's how.

## Before you build this site

### 1. Get the prerequisites

Install the following tools if you don't have them already.

- **[nvm][]**, the Node Version Manager.
- **[rvm][]**, the Ruby Version Manager.
- **[Dart][]**
- **[Chrome][]** v63 or later.

> IMPORTANT: Follow the installation instructions for each of the tools
carefully. In particular, configure your shell/environment so
that the tools are available in every terminal/command window you create.

### 2. Clone this repo

1. **Create or choose a directory** to hold this site's Git repository, and the
   other repositories needed to build this site (which will be fetched later);
   for example, `~/git`.
1. **Clone this repo** ([site-webdev][]) into the chosen directory by following
   the instructions given in the GitHub help on [Cloning a repository][].

### 3. Run installation scripts

> NOTE: It is safe to (re-)run all of the commands and scripts given below even
if you already have the required packages installed.

**Open a terminal/command window** and execute the following commands:

1. <code>cd <i>\<path-to-webdev-repo></i></code> &nbsp;&nbsp;# change to
   **root of this repo**, e.g.: `~/git/site-webdev`
1. `source ./scripts/env-set.sh` &nbsp;&nbsp;#
   initialize environment variables; install/use required Node & Ruby version
1. `./scripts/before-install.sh` &nbsp;&nbsp;#
   install core set of required tools
1. `./scripts/install.sh` &nbsp;&nbsp;#
   install everything else needed to build this site

> IMPORTANT:
> - Any time you create a **new terminal/command window** to work on
>   this repo, **repeat steps 1 and 2** above.
> - If you upgrade Dart then rerun all of the steps above.

## Building this site

Once everything is installed, you need to do a full site build at least once:

- `gulp build --dartdoc` &nbsp;&nbsp;# full site build including API docs

The generated site is placed in the `publish` folder. To serve this folder use:

- `superstatic --port 4001`

To view the generated site open [localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001/) in a browser.

You can build, serve, and have a watcher for changes by running the following command:

- `./scripts/serve_local.sh`

> NOTE: Getting `jekyll | Error:Â  Too many open files` under MacOS or Linux?
>   One way to resolve this is to add the following to your `.bashrc`:
>
>      ulimit -n 8192
>
>   and then reboot your machine.

If you'd like to separately build and then serve, the commands are:

- `gulp build --no-dartdoc` &nbsp;&nbsp;# build site without regenerating API docs
- `superstatic --port 4001` &nbsp;&nbsp;# serve site under `publish`

Some `gulp build` options include:

- `--clean` &nbsp;&nbsp;# deletes `publish` and file fragments (nothing else)
- `--[no-]dartdoc[=all|acx|ng|forms|router|test]` &nbsp;&nbsp;#
  generates API docs for named packages (default `all`)
- `--use-cached-api-doc` &nbsp;&nbsp;# will use cached API docs rather than regenerate them;
  without this option API docs are regenerated afresh each time
- `--fast` &nbsp;&nbsp;# skips some one-time setup tasks (can spead up repeated builds)
- `--log=x` &nbsp;&nbsp;# logging level: `debug`, `info`, `warn` (default), `error`

## Rebuilding this site from scratch

If you encounter build problems, or if you haven't build this site in a while,
you might want to rebuild it from scratch,
doing all of the following steps (in order):

```
source ./scripts/env-set.sh  # reset environment vars and (re-)install Node & Ruby
gulp clean                   # clean out all temporary site folders
gulp build --dartdoc         # full site regeneration
./scripts/serve_local.sh
```

If you are still having build problems, you might need to once again step
through the installation instructions.

## Other useful Gulp tasks

```
gulp clean && gulp build --dartdoc  # do a full build from a clean slate
gulp build-deploy                   # build & deploy to active firebase project
gulp git-clean-src  # WARNING WARNING WARNING: this runs `git clean -xdf src`,
                    # so you'll lose uncommitted work under `src`!
```

## Prepping for Dart 2.0

Please add the following comment to docs that will need
updating for Dart 2.0. We're doing what we can now, but some things
are not yet ready.
