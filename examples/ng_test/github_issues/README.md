An example of using the new `NgTestBed` API with AoT-enabled!

To run the demo app locally, simply use `pub`:

```bash
$ pub serve
```

In Chrome, open up http://localhost:8080

You'll see the Angular Dart github issues displayed in a table like you see above.

To see the automated tests running, open up:

1. http://localhost:8081/issue_body_debug.html
2. http://localhost:8081/issue_list_debug.html

The first test is a simple "do we parse the markdown", test.

The second test is an e2e-style test that uses [pageloader][pageloader].

[pageloader]: https://github.com/google/pageloader

## Automated testing

Our test package supports running these tests too!

You can use the `angular_test` executable to compile and run AoT tests:

```bash
$ pub run angular_test
```

This automatically runs `pub serve` to proxy your tests (and compile them) and
runs `pub run test` to run any test tagged with `@Tags(const ['aot])`. It can
safely be used alongside other (non-Angular) tests - just exclude your `aot`
tests from normal runs:

```bash
$ pub run test -x aot
```
